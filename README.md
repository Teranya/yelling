Research has revealed that women who have experienced sexual assault or harassment are more likely to suffer from poor sleep, anxiety, high blood pressure and symptoms of depression. For my piece I decided to visualize this feeling of anxiety, on top of an image that I felt visualized one of the experiences of depression. For my visualization of anxiety, I chose to recreate certain pixels on the image on top of the image itself, as larger circles, so the viewer can still make out the image (of a person seemingly drowning) but it is blurred out and jittery.

Verbal harassment is often brushed off as being not real harassment by many people, and most don’t seem to realise what really constitutes as verbal sexual harassment. To put verbal harassment in the spotlight I decided to use voice volumes as a form of interaction for the entire sketch. Harassment, no matter how it’s spoken or written, can stick in the victim’s head like as if it was shouted at them, so connect that to the entire piece I had the interaction trigger only above a certain amplitude.
